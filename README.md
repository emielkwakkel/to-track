This is an Ionic app build to track hours based upon your location.



To use this template, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy the files from this repository into the [Starter App Base](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base).

### Getting started
Clone the project and run the following commands within the root of the project:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova ios-deploy
$ npm install
$ ionic serve
```

To run the app on your device execute the following commands:
```bash
$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova run ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.
